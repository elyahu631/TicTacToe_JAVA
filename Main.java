    /*Alpha-beta pruning is a sophisticated technique within the minimax algorithm, used to find the best move in games,
     assuming the opponent is also playing optimally.

        Minimax algorithm:

        Searches for the optimal move for a player, taking into account the opponent's play.
        Used in games like chess or tic-tac-toe to help a computer player choose their next move.
        Alpha-beta pruning:

        Reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the game tree.
        Skips the evaluation of certain branches that don't need to be searched because there's already a better
        move available.

        Alpha:

        In this context, alpha represents the best already explored option along the path to the root for the maximizer.
        In simpler terms, it's the best score the maximizer can guarantee for themselves so far.
        When searching through possible moves, if the minimizer finds a move that leads to a score worse than alpha,
        it can stop considering further moves in that direction (as the maximizer already has a better option).
        Beta:

        Similarly, beta is the counterpart for the minimizer.
        It represents the best already explored option for the minimizer.
        If the maximizer encounters a situation that leads to a score better than beta, it can stop exploring further as
        the minimizer would avoid that path.

        How it works?

        Alpha and beta are passed down the game tree together during the recursive calls of the minimax algorithm.
        They are updated and used to prune unnecessary branches, thus significantly reducing the number of nodes that
        need to be evaluated, thus optimizing the decision-making process.
        In conclusion, alpha-beta pruning is an efficient technique that improves the speed of the decision-making
        process in the minimax algorithm.
